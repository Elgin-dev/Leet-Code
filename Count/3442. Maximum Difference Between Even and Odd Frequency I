You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:
  a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
  a2 has an even frequency in the string.
  Return this maximum difference.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"
Output: 1
Explanation:
The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.


1.Intuition
The problem requires finding the maximum difference between the frequency of an odd-count character and an even-count character.

2.Approach:
  *Character Frequency Counting: Use a dictionary to store the occurrence of each character.
  *Separate Odd & Even Frequencies: Iterate through the frequency dictionary and categorize values into odd and even lists.
  *Compute Max Difference:
  *Find the largest odd frequency (max(odd_frequencies)).
  *Find the smallest even frequency (min(even_frequencies)).
  *Compute the result: max(odd_frequencies) - min(even_frequencies).

3.Why This Works:
  *Taking the maximum odd ensures we subtract the largest possible value.
  *Taking the minimum even ensures the smallest number is subtracted, maximizing the difference.

4.Complexity Analysis:
  Counting characters → O(n)
  Separating odd/even → O(26) ≈ O(1) (since only lowercase letters are present)
  Finding max/min → O(1)
  Overall Complexity → O(n)

5.Code:
class Solution(object):
    def maxDifference(self, s):
        count={}
        for char in s:
            if char in count:
                count[char]+=1
            else:
                count[char]=1
        odd_f=[freq for freq in count.values() if freq%2!=0]
        even_f=[freq for freq in count.values() if freq%2==0]
        if not odd_f or not even_f:
            return -1 
           

        return max(odd_f) - min(even_f)
